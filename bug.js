This bug occurs when using the Expo `useLocalAuthentication` hook with Android devices running Android 13 and above. The `authenticateAsync` function fails to prompt the user for biometric authentication, returning an error instead. This can manifest as an empty error object or an error with the code 'canceled'. The issue is inconsistent and doesn't always occur, making it difficult to debug.  The behavior is different from Android versions below 13 where it works as expected.
